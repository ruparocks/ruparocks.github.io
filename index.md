## MISSION 
Curious is and curious does. I strive to continue to learn and dive deeper into technology and how things work.

## PASSION 
Naturally curious and in love with the Internet since the 90s, I've been creating art, websites, videos, and anything else I can wrap my head around. Most recently, I've been feeding my curiosity by deep-diving into the world of iOS and studying Objective C and Swift. I continue to stay active with Javascript and everything web, as I can never abandon my first love.

## PASS-TIMES 
I'm the one in the office that likes to pull out a puzzle or a game. At home I tend to spend time with my family, fixing things, cooking, hiking, photography, gardening, helping others, and of course, exploring new tech/coding.
